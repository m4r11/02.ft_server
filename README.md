Subject:
"This topic is intended to introduce you to system administration.  
It will make you aware of the importance of using scripts to automate your tasks.

originally written by Igor Sysoev. For a long time, it has been running on many heavily loaded Russian  
sites including Yandex, Mail.Ru, VK, and Rambler.

What is a Self-Signed SSL Certificate?
A self-signed SSL certificate is a certificate that is signed by the person who created it rather than a trusted certificate authority. Self-signed certificates can have the same level of encryption as the trusted CA-signed SSL certificate.

Web browsers do not recognize the self-signed certificates as valid. When using a self-signed certificate, the web browser shows a warning to the visitor that the web site certificate cannot be verified.
